Built a blog website in Django, by self studying from resources across internet, including official documentation, youtube lectures and stackoverflow. My main focus was to learn making a backend with django, so frontend of the website is not very much polished.

The key features of website are:

o Implemented user registration and login functionalities

o Developed profile editing features and enabled image upload for user profiles

o Integrated Django CKEditor for rich text editing in blog posts

o Added functionality for users such as posting blogs, liking and commenting on blogs to enhance user interaction

o Integrated reCAPTCHA for enhanced security on the contact us page

o Ensured a responsive and user-friendly interface throughout the application
